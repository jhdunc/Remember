# Remember
A game designed and developed by Reckless Force in GameMaker

(a year 1 CMGT project group)

Remember is a 2D RPG game project created by students in their first year. 
The player begins as a ghost, with no memory of their past. 
The game encourages them to interact with their surroundings and make choices which will impact what kind of life they remember, if they remember one at all..
